## Rules:
* Please use Git for version control. We expect you to send us a standard zip or tarballâ€‹ of your source code when you're done that includes Git metadata (the .git folder) in the tarball so we can look at your commit logs and understand how your solution evolved. Frequent commits are a huge plus.
* Use the internet for reference perspective
* Use your choice of libraries and open source components
* Please do not make either your solution publicly available by, for example, using github or bitbucket or by posting this problem to a blog or forum
* Please add a README file with relevant details
